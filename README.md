# disable-pinch-zoom
Disable the pinch zoom mouse function in Linux.  

This code was written to disable the pinch zoom function for the logitech K400+ on linux.

Note: Another way might be to enable "slow keys" and set the delay close to 0.  
...And maybe disable the sound theme if any to mute key register sounds.
